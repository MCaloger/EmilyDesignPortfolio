SCOR: 40th Anniversary in Canada
————————————————————————————————————
To celebrate their 40th Anniversary of Canadian presence, our client requested a video showcasing their achievements during this time. This video was to have an animated line creating physical symbols repressing the discussed milestones. 

I designed and animated the line and symbols, supers, subtitles and text transitions in accordance with the client’s existing brand guidelines. All other materials were provided.

Shown below is a small part of the English version.
