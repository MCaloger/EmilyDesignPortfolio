Camden Towne Website
————————————————————————————————————
Camden Towne requested a website design through my employer. My resulting design is an ode to the Arts and Crafts movement, as requested by the client. 



NOTE:
—————

Please use “EM_CamdenTowneWebsite_Thumbnail” as the project page thumbnail, but only include the large PNG file on the project page itself. 


Thank you!
