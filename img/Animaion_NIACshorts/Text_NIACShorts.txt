NIAC Shorts
————————————————————————————————————

Over my three and a half years at a design firm, I did a handful of animations for the Nuclear Insurance Association of Canada (NIAC). 

Below are a few samples of these animations, featuring their palette of red, white and black. These animations were from different projects and thus had different purposes, but most animations were built to explain a concept or service. 

 
NOTE:
—————

The project page should NOT include the thumbnail. 

Do not include the red marked files anywhere.

Please only include the “Document Upload” clip on the animations page, but put all the non-sound animations on the project page.


Thank you!
