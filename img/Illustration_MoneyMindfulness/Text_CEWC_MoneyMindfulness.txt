CEWC Money Mindfulness

This header image was created for Credit Canada’s 2019 Credit Education week themed around  Money Mindfulness. This theme was used again for 2020 and thus my image made a second appearance. 



NOTE:
—————

Please use “EM_MoneyMindfulness_Thumbnail.png” as the project page thumbnail.

In the project page, please use whichever image works better. The thumbnail is square, the other one is the original rectangle size. 

In the “Illustrations” page, please use the rectangular format (EM_MoneyMindfulness_2019.png)

Thank you!
