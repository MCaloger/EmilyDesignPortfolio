Whiteboard Explainer Video
————————————————————————————————————

This animation is part of a revamp of a preexisting video. The original video was created for the client to explain the benefits of animated videos across five points. 

My goal was to recreate the existing video as closely as possible in After Effects while also adding a few more flourishes, such as the radiating lines originating from the lightbulb in the clip below.

The project page should NOT include the thumbnail. 


Thank you!
