A logo and pattern made for a sustainable seafood company featuring a cool summery palette. 



NOTE:
—————

Please keep both the pattern and logo variations together on the projects page. 
On the MerMade project page, please put the yellow logo first, then the pattern. The pattern should be followed by the blue, then pink, then orange logos. 


On the logos page, please only show the yellow MerMade logo (since the rest will be on the actual project page). 


Please also include the MerMade pattern in the patterns page. Thank you!
