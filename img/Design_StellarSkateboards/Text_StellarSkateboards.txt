Stellar
————————————————————————————————————
A skate/lifestyle brand exploration. The goal was to combine outdoor imagery with a smooth, minimalist style so that it would be carefree, surreal, and grounded at the same time. We’re having fun out here doing our own thing, but it’s serious business.

NOTE:
—————

Please put the logo first, then the boards (City, Valley, Desert, Glacier), then the clothes. 

Do not include the thumbnail in the project page.

Please also put the city board in the illustration section as a link to the Stellar project page.

Thank you!
