Credit Canada Bus Backs
————————————————————————————————————
Credit Canada commissioned several bus back layouts from my employer as part of a campaign advertising their debt counselling services. 

Pictured below are the individual bus back images that I personally worked on. The client provided the copy; I created the illustrations and layouts. 



NOTE:
—————

Please use “EM_CCBusback_Sept2019_Thumbnail” as the project page thumbnail.

In the project page, please put the images in the following order: 

Plug, Baby, Sleeping Man, Snowman, Stop

Leave the Butt one out for now because I can’t remember if I did that one or not.

Thank you!
