This actually started as a farmer’s market logo but the combination of a barn silo and corn greenery proved a little unsavoury. 

A pivot to green energy made sense, and this lightbulb corn combo was born!

Some process images included below. The sketch was from a short subway trip where I was pretty sure that the silo thing wasn’t worth salvaging. 

 
NOTE:

The project page should include the thumbnail, sketch and process images in that order. 

Thank you!
