Just Peachy

This actually started as a farmer’s market logo but the combination of a barn silo and corn greenery proved a little unsavoury. 

A pivot to green energy made sense, and this lightbulb corn combo was born!

Some process images included below. The sketch was from a short subway trip where I was pretty sure that the silo thing wasn’t worth salvaging. 

 
NOTE:

The project page should include both MP4s and Thumbnails. Please put them in the following order: light thumbnail, light animation; dark thumbnail, dark animation

Please also put the light thumbnail in the illustration section.

Thank you!
