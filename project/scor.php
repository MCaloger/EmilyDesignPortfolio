                            To celebrate their 40th Anniversary of Canadian presence, our client requested a video showcasing their achievements during this time. This video was to have an animated line creating physical symbols repressing the discussed milestones. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I designed and animated the line and symbols, supers, subtitles and text transitions in accordance with the clientâ€™s existing brand guidelines. All other materials were provided.
                        </p>
